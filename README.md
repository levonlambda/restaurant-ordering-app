# Restaurant Ordering App
This is my version 1 implementation of the [Restaurant Ordering App](https://www.figma.com/file/Hdgwo69Dym9vVsxbuPbl0h/Mobile-Restaurant-Menu?type=design&node-id=0-1&t=cN2TRUUoC6UqgIsK-0) based on the Figma design.

The project is built using **HTML5**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**.
<br><br>
# Features
- Static list of menu items with "Add" buttons for each item.
- Order summary section displaying the ordered items.
    - "Remove" links to remove specific items from the order.
    - "Complete Order" button to finalize the order.
- Modal payment screen where users can input their credit card details.
- Thank you message displayed after the payment is completed.
<br><br>
# Future Plans
For the next version (version 2), I plan to implement the following improvements:
- Integrate a Firebase NoSQL database to manage menu items and record order transactions.
- Implement dynamic menu item loading from the backend database.
- Enhance the user interface with better styling.
- Add functionality for tracking order status and sending notifications.
- Optimize the app for mobile responsiveness and performance.
